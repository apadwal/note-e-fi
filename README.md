NOTE-e-FI
==========

## Problem
Teachers need to easily notify and track academic performance, achievement data, attendance and anecdotals to parents and students while making their efforts transparent to administrators and staff. This will enable staff collaboration through this open communication.

## The Solution
NOTE-e-FI is a system that allows educators to send notes to parents, students and colleagues using filters based off of data housed in the SLC. Notes can be translated into home language using Azure translations. Logs are kept for each message to allow sharing of outreach information amongst school staff members. Messages and logs are also written back to the SLC.
